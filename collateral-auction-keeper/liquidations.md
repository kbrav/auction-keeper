# Liquidations & Collateral Auctions

## Liquidations

The collateral keeper will liquidate all critical safes it encounters. This process starts new fixed discount collateral auctions:

```

## Auctions

After an auction is started, the collateral keeper will be able to bid for and buy collateral at a discounted price:

```

**Bidding Gotchas**

1\) By default, the keeper submits a bid using all of its available system coins. This ensures the keeper gets the maximum amount of discounted collateral in one go.

2\) If there are multiple ongoing auctions, you might see this error until the first `buyCollateral` transaction is finished:

`Bid cost 5025.307970008628887936000000000000000000000000000 exceeds reservoir level of 0.000000000000000000411195000000000000000000000; bid will not be submitted`
{% endhint %}

## Swapping Bought Collateral for System Coins

The collateral keeper can swap collateral for system coins automatically when it's exited from the system using Uniswap V2. This allows the keeper to have plenty of system coins available next time it starts.To turn this option on, use this flag inside `run_auction_keeper.sh`:

`--swap-collateral`

To set the max allowable slippage percentage on Uniswap V2, set this flag:

`--max-swap-slippage <float>, default: 0.01`

{% hint style="info" %}
Use `--swap-collateral` with `--safe-engine-system-coin-target ALL`\(the default\) to ensure won collateral is automatically converted to system coins
{% endhint %}

## Exiting Collateral from the System

By default, the keeper will periodically exit collateral \(that was bought from auctions\) from the system.  

To adjust the interval at which the keeper exits collateral, set:

`--return-collateral-interval, default:300 secs`

By default, the keeper will `exit` all of its collateral when it's shutting down. 

To leave won collateral in the system on exit, specify this inside `run_auction_keeper.sh`:  
`--keep-collateral-in-safe-engine-on-exit`
